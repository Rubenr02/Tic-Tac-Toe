# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to  Pygame Tic-Tac-Toe! This game is a basic implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built using the Pygame library. While it's simple, it was a great way to learn the fundamentals of game development with Pygame.

# Game Overview
The game is a 2-player version of Tic-Tac-Toe, where one player is "X" and the other is "O."

The objective is to be the first player to get three of their marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

# How to Play
Launch the game by running the script in your Python environment. Make sure you have Pygame installed.

-A 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid will appear on the screen. Each cell of the grid represents a spot where a player can place their "X" or "O."

-Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their mark. The game automatically switches between "X" and "O" players.

-The game will detect a winner when one player gets three of their marks in a row or when the grid is full (a draw).

-If a player wins or the game ends in a draw, the game will print the result in the console and exit.
